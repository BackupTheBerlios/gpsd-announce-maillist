Subject: [Gpsd-announce] Announcing release 2.6 of gpsd
Message-ID: <200501011633.j01GX7Y7012513@snark.thyrsus.com>

Release 2.6 of gpsd is now available at:

	http://developer.berlios.de/projects/gpsd/

Here are the most recent changes:

- Petter Reinholdtsen's fix for gps.py buffering.  Fix syntax errors
  in udev scriptlets.  Clean up after GCC warning messages.  Drop use of 
  vsprintf, so we get a link-time error on systems that might produce 
  buffer overruns (all modern Unixes support vsnsprintf which is safe).

Release 2.7 of gpsd is now available at:

	http://developer.berlios.de/projects/gpsd/

Here are the most recent changes:

- More compiler-warning cleanups.  gps client name changed to xgps.
  Added --speedunits option to xgpsspeed, --speedunits and --altunits
  options to xgps.  Improved GPGSV parsing so it copes gracefully if
  we start in the middle of a sequence.  Merged Petter Reinholdtsen's
  fix for GPGSA lists with holes.  In xgps, satellites used in the
  last fix are now dotted in the middle.  New -P option to create
  pidfile.  Audited for potential buffer overruns, found and fixed
  two.
