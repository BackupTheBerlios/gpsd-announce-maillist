Subject: [Gpsd-announce] Release of GPSD 2.90 draws near
Message-ID: <20091120214206.EFA3F28E069@thyrsus.com>

It's been a long epic, but we expect to release the 2.90 version of
GPSD very soon. I'm planning to call freeze on Monday, after which
only urgent bug fixes will be accepted and we may ship at any time.

The release number has been bumped to 2.90 to reflect the fact that
there have been major changes since 2.39 in March, and the next
few minor releases will be preparatory for 3.00 in which we drop the 
old pre-JSON GPSD protocol.

Please get your last-minute features and your bug reports in this
weekend.

Highlights of the upcoming release will include:

* New JSON-based protocol fully deployed and documented, with all test
  clients converted. libgps will support both protocols, with
  application writers not needing to care which the daemon is actually
  emitting.

* No more jitter!  The daemon now does reliable detection of cycle
  start and end on NMEA devices.

* gpsd now accepts error estimates from the NMEA $GPGBS sentence.

* Major improvements and stabilization work on PPS.

* Unpacked AIS reports will be available through the client library
  for those with AIS receivers.

For client application developers: a major point of this release is to
get the new client library (libgps) deployed. Once you convert your code to use
it, you should be able to ignore the rest of the wire protocol
transition. See <http://gpsd.berlios.de/protocol-transition.html> for
transition help.
