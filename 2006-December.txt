This one was a bit bumpy, but no more so than I'd expect first time out.
A round of applause for Chris, everybody!

And a good thing it is for me not to be indispensibly critical-path on this.
While I don't plan on leaving the project in the foreseable future, it's
comforting to know that we're growing more leadership.
