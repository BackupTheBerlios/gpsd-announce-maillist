Subject: [Gpsd-announce] Announcing release 2.10 of gpsd
Message-ID: <200502031141.j13Bfk2q019542@snark.thyrsus.com>

Release 2.10 of gpsd is now available at:

	http://developer.berlios.de/projects/gpsd/

Here are the most recent changes:

- Add -N option to explicitly foreground the daemon.  Fixed a bug
  that was causing gpsd to keep reopening the GPS device after
  leaving raw or watcher mode.  Fixed Gary Miller's core-dump bug.

Message-ID: <200502102325.j1ANP0Ot007589@snark.thyrsus.com>

Release 2.11 of gpsd is now available at:

	http://developer.berlios.de/projects/gpsd/

Here are the most recent changes:

- Added gpsprof and the capability to generate GPS latency profiles.
  gpsprobe now hunts through plausible baud rates when looking for NMEA
  data from a GPS. The -b (baudrate) option fixes a speed, disabling
  the baud-matching logic.  Also, gpsprobe can now recognize SiRF 
  protocol, though not speak it.  Fixed a math domain error in 
  gps.EarthDistance due to numeric blowup on points very close together,
  and another in gps.MeterOffset() that was screwing up gpsprobe plots.

Subject: [Gpsd-announce] Announcing release 2.12 of gpsd
Message-ID: <200502151049.j1FAnmqs020836@snark.thyrsus.com>

Release 2.12 of gpsd is now available at:

	http://developer.berlios.de/projects/gpsd/

Here are the most recent changes:

- Fixed core-dump bug in processing of the GLL variant that does not
  include an FAA Mode Indicator. When using the NMEA driver, gpsd now
  hunts for a baud rate rather than requiring a fixed one to be set.
  A new 'B' command returns the RS232 parameters, and a new 'C'
  command returns the update cycle time.  Added gpsfake test harness.
  Alpha driver for Garmin binary protocol added, requires Linux
  garmin_usb kernel driver.  The daemon now always passes up a
  timestamp for every sentence that has one, even if the PVT fields
  aren't valid.

Subject: [Gpsd-announce] Announcing release 2.13 of gpsd
Message-ID: <200502220407.j1M47aVB031108@snark.thyrsus.com>

Release 2.13 of gpsd is now available at:

	http://developer.berlios.de/projects/gpsd/

Here are the most recent changes:

- Correct a bug in binary-protocol dumping (applies to Zodiac and
  Garmin only).  Gary Miller's patch to deal gracefully with GPSes
  like the Magellan EC10X that send only GPRMC and never GPGGA or
  GPGSA, and thus never set mode or status fields.  Fixed buggy
  handling of units options in xgps and xgpsspeed.  Bumped library
  major version, since seen_sentences is now exposed and drivers have
  more capabilities.  Stricter NMEA buffer validation.  Withdrew the
  change that always passed up a timestamp; on SiRF-IIs, the year part
  is garbage when the PVT fields are garbage.  Can now recognize
  SiRF-II GPSes.  Experimental baud-switching support for Zodiac.

Message-ID: <200502251123.j1PBN0IA014749@snark.thyrsus.com>

Release 2.14 of gpsd is now available at:

	http://developer.berlios.de/projects/gpsd/

Here are the most recent changes:

- Pass zero magnetic variation in generated NMEA from binary GPSes
  correctly.  Use O_SYNC rather than timeouts to guarantee that 
  baud-rate change strings get to the GPS before changing the line
  parameters.  Introduced I command.  Spatial scattergram plotting
  moved from gpsprobe to gpsprof.
