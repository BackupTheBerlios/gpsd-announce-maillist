Subject: [Gpsd-announce] Announcing release 2.20 of gpsd
Message-ID: <200504010036.j310abN1029199@snark.thyrsus.com>

Release 2.20 of gpsd is now available at:

	http://developer.berlios.de/projects/gpsd/

Here are the most recent changes:

- Rob Janssen's patches to fix timezone issues and improve cooperation
  with NTP.  License changed to BSD so linking to libgps won't make people 
  nervous.  gpsprobe and gpsd.py are obsolete and have been removed, the 
  autoprobe and profiling capabilities in the daemon more than replace 
  them.  gpsprof now ships self-contained GNUPLOT scripts to stdout,
  so they can be saved and redisplayed.  Zodiac sort of works again, but 
  occasionally spins madly during autobauding.
