Message-ID: <200503021547.j22Fl998005596@snark.thyrsus.com>

Release 2.15 of gpsd is now available at:

	http://developer.berlios.de/projects/gpsd/

Here are the most recent changes:

- A new packet engine autobauds much more quickly, and now iterates
  over both 1 and 2 stopbits. Explicit support for FV18 (the -T f
  option) is gone; instead, gpsd syncs with any 7N2 device and always
  ships a suitable init string.  New E command, supporting the Garmin
  position-error sentence or computing these numbers from DOP and an
  error model. New U command reports climb/sink from GPSes that report
  vertical velocity.  There is a prototype driver for SiRF-binary GPses,
  invoked automatically when SiRF packets present themselves on the
  wire after device open.

	http://developer.berlios.de/projects/gpsd/

Here are the most recent changes:

- New F command allows changing the GPS device after startup time.
  Hotplug scripts to go with it are now installed by the RPM.  The
  Garmin probe is working.  The -T and -s options are gone.  We have 
  achieved zero configuration!

Message-ID: <200503162159.j2GLxe57010548@snark.thyrsus.com>

Release 2.17 of gpsd is now available at:

	http://developer.berlios.de/projects/gpsd/

Here are the most recent changes:

- Fix packet-engine problem that made disconnect/reconnect unreliable
  (important!).  Fix bonehead error in interpretation of PGRME.  We 
  don't use O_SYNC (it turned out not to be reliable) so remove it to make 
  life easier under Mac OS X.  Allow gpsfake to accept subsecond cycle times.
  Add a FAQ to the HTML documentation.  gps_poll() now handles multi-line
  responses.  Add N command for switching driver modes.

Release 2.18 of gpsd is now available at:

	http://developer.berlios.de/projects/gpsd/

Here are the most recent changes:

- First cut at cooperating with NTP.  Major library restructuring; 
  a fix is now a data structure of its own, and per-field timestamps 
  are gone. Use new 'o' command for watcher mode.  Compute some estimated 
  error bounds.

Garmin binary support is broken in 2.18.  Can I get a days notice for
testing next time before a release?

Release 2.19 of gpsd is now available at:

	http://developer.berlios.de/projects/gpsd/

Here are the most recent changes:

- Fix brown-paper-bag bug with NMEA parsing. Set SiRF GPSes to use
  SBAS.  sirfmon now displays SBAS parameters, and is included in the
  installed programs.  Add to FAQ a fix for spurious high speeds reported
  in XTrac mode.  We now interpret GPZDA.  We no longer fudge a missing 
  ddmmyy in NMEA timestamps from the system clock, so replay will work better.
