Subject: [Gpsd-announce] Announcing release 2.26 of gpsd
Message-ID: <200506221217.j5MCHlWD000408@snark.thyrsus.com>

Release 2.26 of gpsd is now available at:

	http://developer.berlios.de/projects/gpsd/

Here are the most recent changes:

- Time DOP and total DOP are now passed on from GPSes that report
  them.  Ensure longitude has a leading zero when <100, for
  compatibility with gpsdrive.  Synchronous and thread hooks are now
  separate in the client library.  Packet-sniffing on a new device no
  longer holds up incoming data on already-connected ones.  There is
  now a super-raw mode (R=2) that dumps a hex-encoding of every binary
  packet received to the client; sirfmon uses it to operate through
  the daemon if one is running.  Support for Trimble TSIP GPSes
  merged. gpsfake now works with SiRF and Zodiac logs.  Python library
  supports thread callbacks.  New -p option of gpsfake supports
  regression testing of the daemon, and there is a test suite included
  with the distribution.  PPS support is turned off, as there is some
  pthreads problem that sometimes kills the daemon on pthreads exit.
  Correct off-by-one error in GPZDA processing.  The code has been
  audited and cleaned with splint (www.splint.org).
