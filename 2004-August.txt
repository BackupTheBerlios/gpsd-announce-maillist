Subject: [Gpsd-announce] Announcing release 1.91 of gpsd
Message-ID: <200408220248.i7M2mmPW023356@snark.thyrsus.com>

Release 1.91 of gpsd is now available at:

	http://berlios.de/gpsd/

Here are the most recent changes:

- Second pre-2.0 release.  Features a linkable C library that hides the 
  details of communicating with the daemon.  The daemon now recovers
  gracefully from having the GPS unplugged and plugged in at any time;
  one of the bits of status it can report is whether the GPS is online.
  The gps and xgpsspeed clients now query the daemon; their code 
  for direct access to the serial port has been deliberately removed.

Release 1.92 of gpsd is now available at:

	http://berlios.de/gpsd/

Here are the most recent changes:

- Third prerelease.  Clients in watcher mode now get notified when
  the GPS goes online or offline.  Major name changes -- old libgps
  is new libgpsd and vice-versa (so the high-level interface is more
  prominent.  Specfile now includes code to install gpsd so it will
  be started at boot time.  -D2 now causes command error messages
  to be echoed to the client.

  are now in ISO8601 format, with sub-second precision if the GPS
  delivers that.  First cuts at Python interfaces included.  libgps.a
  interface now bundles session fd into an allocated session block.
  Automake-based build machinery from Jens Oberender; RPM now
  installs shared libraries.  FV18 driver added. Offline timer in GPS.
