Subject: [Gpsd-announce] Announcing release 2.27 of gpsd
Message-ID: <200507061145.j66Bj04E020289@snark.thyrsus.com>

Release 2.27 of gpsd is now available at:

	http://developer.berlios.de/projects/gpsd/

Here are the most recent changes:

- Arrange for the daemon to remove its pid file on exit.  Fix some
  buffering problems with the Python side of the hotplug interface.
  gpsfake can now run sessions under a monitor like Valgrind.  Most
  of the gpsfake logic now lives in a module that can be used to write
  other test loads; its progress baton is now optional.  Fixed
  some minor bugs found by valgrind audit, including (1) a slow
  memory leak, (2) a possible but unconfirmed file-descriptor leak, 
  and (3) a subtle error in the channel-assignment logic that only
  showed up with multiple sessions active.  In fact, the daemon code
  no longer uses dynamic-memory allocation at all.  Also, the code
  no longer relies on FIONREAD working.  The track error field in the
  O response is now computed.  The project website has some new eye candy.
  Client connections now time out when the mode is neither raw nor watcher.

Release 2.28 of gpsd is now available at:

	http://developer.berlios.de/projects/gpsd/

Here are the most recent changes:

- The 2.27 source tarball somehow got truncated on upload.
  Due to procedural mechanics at berlios.de, shipping a new release
  seems to be the least painful way to recover.  This release is
  identical to 2.27 except the roadmap stuff has been added to TODO.
