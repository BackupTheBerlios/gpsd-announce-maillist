Subject: [Gpsd-announce] Announcing release 2.4 of gpsd
Message-ID: <200412151651.iBFGpHXp021909@snark.thyrsus.com>

Release 2.4 of gpsd is now available at:

	http://developer.berlios.de/projects/gpsd/

Here are the most recent changes:

- Minor bugs in gpsd.py fixed.  M now returns 0 status if GPGSA not yet
  seen; this change also fixes a bug where gpsd claimed it was confused
  if GPGSA had not been seen and status was set.  RPM will now install 
  a udevd rule if the host system uses it.  Don't set the online flag
  on activate.  HP port changes and -Wall cleanup.  James Cameron's 
  fixes to clean up gps.c and use X timeouts rather than alarms.

Release 2.5 of gpsd is now available at:

	http://developer.berlios.de/projects/gpsd/

Here are the most recent changes:

- Use gmtime instead of localtime when guessing the day or year of a date;
  this avoids jitter in the day after 19:00 GMT.  Added -v option to dump 
  version and exit.  Commented out a crash-causing debug line in gps.py.
