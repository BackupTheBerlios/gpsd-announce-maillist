Release 2.23 of gpsd is now available at:

	http://developer.berlios.de/projects/gpsd/

Here are the most recent changes:

- For better security, the daemon now drops root privileges after startup.
  gpsd-clients is now a separate RPM; this is helpful on lean systems
  that don't run X.  The O command now reports speeds in meters per second 
  rather than knots, client code has been adjusted so there is no user-visible
  change.  We now compute the missing components of DOP when using SiRF chips.
  /dev/gps is no longer special; there is no default GPS device unless you
  specify one.  The intermittent processor-hogging problem introduced by the
  control-channel change in 2.21 has been solved.

Release 2.24 of gpsd is now available at:

	http://developer.berlios.de/projects/gpsd/

Here are the most recent changes:

- Crazy-speed bug is finally fixed. Autobauding now starts with the
  current speed of the device, not the stored gpsd speed; this means
  hunting only takes place when device and GPS speed aren't matched.  
  xgpsspeed unit-conversion bug introduced in 2.22 is fixed.  Satellite
  display now really shows 12 channels, not just 11.  Make configure
  honor the --without-x option.  Major improvements in ntp notifications.

Yay the speed bug is fixed.

Message-ID: <200505210419.j4L4JRTf032183@snark.thyrsus.com>

Release 2.25 of gpsd is now available at:

	http://developer.berlios.de/projects/gpsd/

Here are the most recent changes:

- Various signedness and scaling fixes and an OpenBSD port patch for the 
  Zodiac driver. Command-line arguments to gpsd are now treated as a default 
  device list; -f is still supported but deprecated.  sirfmon now tries not
  changing the line speed first, so it syncs up much faster.  Prevent a 
  potential buffer overrun in the client library.  PPS-thread support is now
  on by default.  Lots of documentation improvements. D-BUS broadcast support 
  by Amaury Jacquot.  Added Alfredo Pironti's thread-callback and C++
  support.  gpsd no longer uses the system clock for anything, so it
  can be used to set that clock.
