Release 2.0 of gpsd is now available at:

	http://developer.berlios.de/projects/gpsd/

Here are the most recent changes:

- Various internal cleanups, including fossil removal in the
  configuration machinery.  FV-18, Tripmate, Earthmate and are now
  enabled but can be disable with --disable-$NAME at configure time.
  When you call configure with --disable-shared, libgps is linked
  statically to the binaries (native libs are still linked
  shared). Fixed buggy handling of -p option in gps.c and xgpsspeed.c;
  it's now an optional command-line argument.
